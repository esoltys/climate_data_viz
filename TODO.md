Potential next steps we could consider:

1. Enhance the visualization:
   - Add more interactive elements like tooltips or clickable elements
   - Implement a time series chart to show temperature trends over multiple months or years
   - Create a heatmap visualization to show temperature distribution across different latitudes and longitudes

2. Expand data retrieval:
   - Allow users to select different climate variables (e.g., precipitation, wind speed)
   - Implement date range selection for fetching data over longer periods

3. Improve the user interface:
   - Create a more polished frontend with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind
   - Add form inputs for users to select the year, month, and climate variables they want to visualize

4. Implement additional data analysis:
   - Add statistical analysis tools, such as trend detection or anomaly highlighting
   - Incorporate machine learning models for temperature prediction

5. Optimize performance:
   - Implement server-side rendering for faster initial page loads
   - Use web workers for data processing to keep the UI responsive

6. Add more robust error handling and user feedback:
   - Implement loading indicators while data is being fetched or processed
   - Provide more detailed error messages and suggestions for troubleshooting

7. Upgrade to the new Beta CDS api as the current one is being deprecated in September

8. AI Integration:
   - Generate forecasts
   - Detect anomalies

9. Documentation:
   - Create API documentation using tools like Swagger UI (which FastAPI supports out of the box).

---

Here's an explanation of each package in the `requirements.txt`:

1. `fastapi`: The web framework we're using for building APIs.
2. `uvicorn`: ASGI server, used to run FastAPI applications.
3. `cdsapi`: Client to access Copernicus Climate Data Store.
4. `xarray`: For working with multi-dimensional arrays, particularly useful for climate data.
5. `netCDF4`: For reading and writing NetCDF files, a common format for climate data.
6. `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
7. `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
8. `azure-ai-anomalydetector`: Azure's Anomaly Detector client library.
9. `python-dotenv`: To load environment variables from a .env file.
10. `pydantic`: For data validation, used heavily by FastAPI.
11. `requests`: For making HTTP requests, which might be useful for additional API integrations.
